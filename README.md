This repository is a part of ![Classification of Insincere Questions(CIQ)](https://sites.google.com/view/insincerequestiontask/home?authuser=0) track at FIRE 2019. We have used combinations of  different word embedding techniques namely Glove, FastText, and Paragram. Our model is based on a Bidirectional LSTM-GRU network coupled with checkpoint ensembling for the fine-grained classification of insincere questions into the following categories:
1) Rhetorical Questions
2) Hate Speech
3) Sexual Content
4) Hypothetical Questions
5) Other
6) Sincere Question

The final code/model used can be found ![here](https://github.com/diptamath/CIQ-Challenge/blob/master/Full%20Model.py)

The model architecture is shown below:

Our approach was awarded the First Prize for this competition with an overall F1 score of 67.32%

# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
